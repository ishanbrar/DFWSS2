            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                Just as our ancestors maintained the most effective weapons of their time, today's Sikhs have a duty to be properly equipped with modern defensive tools. Modern rifles and handguns should be respected and understood, not feared. They are extensions of our tradition of preparedness and protection.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                History has shown that evil does not rest, and the only way to prevent suffering at the hands of tyrants is to maintain the highest level of defensive capability legally permitted. This includes modern sporting rifles and similar platforms - if those who wish harm can access such tools, it is our duty to be equally prepared to defend the innocent.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                Remember that Guru Gobind Singh Ji equipped the Khalsa with the most advanced arms available in their time. Today, we honor that tradition by maintaining proficiency with modern defensive tools while upholding the same principles of restraint, discipline, and righteousness.

            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                Modern firearms, including rifles and handguns, should be viewed as tools of liberation and protection, not instruments of fear. They represent our continued commitment to defending dharma in an evolving world. Just as our ancestors mastered the weapons of their time, we must embrace and understand contemporary defensive tools.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Maximum Preparedness</h2>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                History has repeatedly shown that evil persists, and the only effective deterrent is maintaining the highest level of defensive capability within legal bounds. This includes modern sporting rifles and similar platforms - when those who intend harm have access to such tools, we have a sacred duty to be equally prepared to protect the innocent.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                Our tradition demands we remain properly equipped and trained with the most effective defensive tools available. This preparedness serves as both deterrent and protection, upholding our historical responsibility as guardians of righteousness.
