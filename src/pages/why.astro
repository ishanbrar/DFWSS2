        <div class="mb-8">
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                The Sikh tradition of being armed and prepared stems from centuries of standing against tyranny and protecting the defenseless. Guru Gobind Singh Ji, our tenth Guru, transformed the Sikh community into the Khalsa - a community of saint-soldiers ready to defend truth and justice.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                In modern times, this sacred duty continues. As Sikhs, we train not for aggression, but for protection - of ourselves, our families, and anyone facing oppression. This commitment to being "Tyar Bar Tyar" (Always Prepared) is more than just physical training; it's a spiritual discipline that keeps us vigilant and ready to uphold our values.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                Our martial tradition, Shastar Vidya, combines spiritual awareness with physical preparedness. It reminds us that a Sikh's weapons are tools of last resort, to be used only in defense of righteousness when all peaceful means have failed.

            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji emphasizes the warrior spirit, with numerous references to weapons (shastar) as divine tools for protecting righteousness. Guru Gobind Singh Ji further elevated this principle, declaring "Shastar Naam Mala" - recognizing weapons as sacred extensions of divine will when used in defense of dharma.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                In Dasam Granth, Guru Gobind Singh Ji explicitly states that weapons must be respected and maintained with the same devotion as prayer. The text emphasizes that a Sikh's martial capabilities are inseparable from their spiritual development - two edges of the same sword.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Divine Command</h2>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                "ਸ਼ਸਤ੍ਰ ਹੀਣ ਕਬਹੂ ਨਹਿ ਹੋਈ, ਰਿਖੀ ਰਾਜ ਸਦਾਈਯੈ ਸੋਈ" - Guru Gobind Singh Ji commands that a Sikh must never be without arms. This divine ordinance makes clear that being armed and trained is not optional - it is a fundamental duty of the Khalsa.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                The Zafarnama further reinforces this, with Guru Gobind Singh Ji explaining that taking up arms becomes not just permissible but necessary when all peaceful means have failed. This wisdom has preserved our faith through centuries of persecution.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">History of Sikh Armed Survival</h2>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                The very existence of Sikhs today is a testament to our ancestors' wisdom in maintaining arms and being prepared. During the darkest periods of persecution, it was the armed and trained Khalsa that stood against tyranny. From the sacrifices of Guru Arjan Dev Ji to the battles of Guru Gobind Singh Ji, our history demonstrates why Sikhs must always remain "Tyar Bar Tyar" - prepared and vigilant.
            </p>
            
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                Under Mughal rule, when bounties were placed on Sikh heads and systematic genocide was attempted, it was armed resistance that preserved our faith. The Khalsa's martial preparedness transformed us from victims to warriors, establishing sovereign rule and protecting the innocent of all faiths across Punjab.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                During the partition of 1947, when murderous mobs targeted Sikh communities, it was again our combat readiness that saved countless lives. Armed Sikhs successfully defended their villages and helped evacuate hundreds of thousands to safety, demonstrating how preparation prevents persecution.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                In the 1980s and 1990s, faced with state-sponsored aggression, Sikhs once again proved that an armed and trained community cannot be easily oppressed. Our history repeatedly shows that maintaining arms and training is not about aggression - it's about survival and the protection of dharma.

         <div class="mb-8">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Eternal Vigilance</h2>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                Today's world demands the same vigilance our ancestors maintained. Whether facing targeted violence or protecting the innocent, Sikhs must maintain the highest level of preparedness. This means regular training, maintaining defensive capabilities, and understanding that our ability to defend ourselves and others is a sacred responsibility passed down through generations.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                The peace and stability we experience today is but a temporary illusion. History has shown repeatedly that periods of peace are merely intervals between cycles of violence and persecution. Our ancestors paid for these lessons in blood, and we would be foolish to ignore their wisdom. Evil does not rest permanently - it merely waits for the prepared to become complacent.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                Just as our forebears maintained readiness through centuries of relative peace and sudden violence, we too must remain prepared. The comfortable bubble of modern society can burst at any moment, and when it does, it will be those who heeded our ancestors' wisdom who will be able to protect themselves and others.
