            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                We are a collective of like-minded Singhs and Kaurs from across the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, united by our dedication to maintaining the Khalsa's martial traditions through modern weapons training. While we attend different Gurdwaras throughout DFW, we come together regularly to train, learn, and grow in our understanding of both traditional Shastar Vidya and contemporary defensive tools.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg mb-6">
                Our members range from experienced marksmen to beginners, but we all share a common understanding: that the responsibility to be armed and trained is inseparable from our Sikhi. We organize regular training sessions, workshops, and educational events focused on responsible firearm ownership, tactical training, and the spiritual aspects of being a warrior-saint in today's world.
