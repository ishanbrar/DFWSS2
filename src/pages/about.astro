            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                We are a collective of like-minded Singhs and Kaurs from across the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, united by our dedication to maintaining the Khalsa's martial traditions through modern weapons training. While we attend different Gurdwaras throughout DFW, we come together regularly to train, learn, and grow in our understanding of both traditional Shastar Vidya and contemporary defensive tools.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg mb-6">
                Our members range from experienced marksmen to beginners, but we all share a common understanding: that the responsibility to be armed and trained is inseparable from our Sikhi. We organize regular training sessions, workshops, and educational events focused on responsible firearm ownership, tactical training, and the spiritual aspects of being a warrior-saint in today's world.

            In the modern era, the Sikh principle of being "Tyar Bar Tyar" (Ready at all times) remains as relevant as ever. Here's why weapons training continues to be an essential part of the Sikh way of life:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-inside list-disc space-y-4" role="list">
            <li>
                <strong>Religious Duty:</strong> Guru Gobind Singh Ji instructed Sikhs to be both Sant (Saints) and Sipahi (Warriors). This dual responsibility continues in the modern world.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <strong>Self-Defense:</strong> In an increasingly uncertain world, the ability to protect oneself and others is crucial. This aligns with the Sikh principle of standing up against injustice.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <strong>Community Protection:</strong> Sikhs have historically been defenders of the oppressed. Modern weapons training enables us to continue this sacred duty.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <strong>Cultural Preservation:</strong> Maintaining proficiency in weapons connects us to our martial heritage and the discipline of Shastar Vidya.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <strong>Mental Discipline:</strong> Weapons training develops focus, discipline, and mindfulness - qualities essential for both spiritual and worldly success.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <strong>Physical Fitness:</strong> Regular training maintains the body as a temple, following the Sikh principle of keeping the body strong and capable.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <strong>Responsibility:</strong> Learning proper weapons handling teaches responsibility, safety, and respect for tools of defense.
            </li>
        </ul>
